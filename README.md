# thicktify
a simple edit of khanas' spicetify rainmeter plugin with thicker padding and brighter colors!
# how to use:
extract the thicktify folder right to your spicetify themes directory!  (probably something like documents/rainmeter/skins/spicetify/themes)  to apply the theme, open the spicetify editor through rainmeter and click the theme arrow in the top left until you get to my theme!
# notes:
this is still a WIP!  any suggestions are greatly appreciated, especially ones involving the removal or editing of the window decorations, which i could not figure out for the life of me!
